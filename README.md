# Code snippet library API (WIP)

Fullstack project for an API where user can browse and CRUD little snippets of code, built with Node.js, Expresss, MongoDB and React frontend. 

Right now neither the browsing or CRUD works, which is work in progress. API is working and hosted at https://fs-project3-ymeb.onrender.com

Working with so many files and using them together turned out to be more challenging than anticipated, together with React which wasn't familiar to me, and the work for this project halted and motivation declined. 

But since this is something I could use for all future personal and professional projects I'll be fixing it sooner or later.

# Each snippet of code contains:
* title

* language (js, python, etc.)

* code

* description

* tags (frontend, backend, etc.)

* created at:

# Tech stack
* Node.js

* Express

* MongoDB Atlas

* Mongoose

* React (Vite)

* Axios

* dotenv

* cors

# Setting up locally & testing:
1. clone this repository
2. setup backend (npm install)
3. create .env file for mongo
4. start backend (npm run dev)
5. setup frontend with same commands in snippet-frontend
6. Test API with browser or with postman / similar (hosted @ https://fs-project3-ymeb.onrender.com)
